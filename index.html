    <h2>Coding Project</h2>
    <h3>Foresight</h3>
   <p>A device that was akin to a backup camera. Fully Wireless using Flash Python and Raspberry Pi Cameras. It live
    streamed a footage from about 200Ft. This device was meant to be a competitive project against existing wireless cameras that sell a standalone monitor for the camera. Our product used your cell phone instead and was cheaper.</p>
